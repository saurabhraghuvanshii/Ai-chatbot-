At the time of writing, the Jenkins organisation let to the maintainer the choice of which issue tracker to use. Available are Github or JIRA issue tracker. For reason discussed in the Jenkins Developers Google Group the official issue tracking for this plugin is JIRA. What means: new issues must be open at JIRA the Github tracker will be froozen, that means no new issues will be accepted depending on the progress I expect that by the date 01/06/2025 the Github issue tracker will be disabled at all What will happen to the issues opened in Github? actual issues will be processed maybe resolved otherwise after 6 months, it will be manually migrated by me to JIRA if it doesn't already exist Notes General notes Unlike GitHub, in Bitbucket, team admins do not have access to forks. This means that when you have a private repository, or a private fork of a public repository, the team admin will not be able to see the PRs within the fork. Developers and DevOps notes Classes under the packages com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.bitbucket.api is intended to be public api and can be used to extend functionality in other plugins. Changes in the method signature will be marked with @deprecated providing an alternative new signature or class to use. After a reasonable time (about a year) the method could be removed at all. If some methods are not intended to be used then are marked with @Restricted(NoExternalUse.class). Classes in other packages are not intended to be used outside of this plugin. Signature can be changed in any moment, backward compatibility are no guaranteed. When implementing a pipeline (scripted or declarative) we encourage the use of symbols instead of using the name (or fully qualified name) of the class. Symbols are safer against possible reorganization of the plugin code (classic examples: renaming the class or moving it to different packages). Compliant example: multibranch: branchSource: bitbucket: repoOwner: 'organization' repository: 'repository' credentialsId: 'bitbucket-credentials' traits: - bitbucketBranchDiscovery: strategyId: 1 - bitbucketSshCheckout: credentialsId: 'bitbucket-ssh-credentials' Noncompliant code example: multibranch: branchSource: bitbucket: repoOwner: 'organization' repository: 'repository' credentialsId: 'bitbucket-credentials' traits: - $class: 'BranchDiscoveryTrait' strategyId: 1 - $class: 'com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.bitbucket.SSHCheckoutTrait': credentialsId: 'bitbucket-ssh-credentials' Release notes (for maintainers) To perform a release of this plugin the minimum requirements are: Maven 3.9.9 JDK 17 git 2.39.x In a shell or Windows terminal run mvn -B -ntp release:prepare release:perform \"-Pquick-build\" \"-P-block-MRP\" How-to run and test with Bitbucket Server locally Install in local PC Install the Atlassian SDK on Linux or Mac Install git To run latest server: atlas-run-standalone --product bitbucket Support to run Server under Windows has been dismissed since version 7.14+ Run inside docker run docker pull nolddor/atlassian-sdk:17-jdk run docker run -it -p 7990:7990 -p 7999:7999 nolddor/atlassian-sdk:17-jdk Inside the container: install git with apk add git run /opt/atlassian-plugin-sdk/bin/atlas-run-standalone --product bitbucket Version: 935.1.2Released: 2 days agoRequires Jenkins 2.479.1ID: cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-sourceInstalled on 25.5% of\u00a0controllersView detailed version informationLinksGitHubOpen issues (Jira)Report an issue (Jira)Open issues (Github)Report an issue (Github)Extension PointsJavadocLabelsbitbucketSource Code ManagementMaintainersAndrew BayerAntonio Mu\u00f1izLiam NewmanCarroll ChiouDevin NusbaumrsandellJose Blas Camacho TaboadaG\u00fcnter GrodotzkiNikolas FalcoHelp us improve this page!To propose a change submit a pull request to the plugin page on GitHub.Previous Security WarningsMissing permission checks allow enumerating credentials IDsAffects version 737.vdf9dc06105be and earlierCSRF vulnerability allows capturing credentialsAffects version 737.vdf9dc06105be and earlierIncorrect trust policy behavior for pull requests from forksAffects version 866.vdea_7dcd3008e and earlierBitbucket OAuth access token exposed in the build logAffects version 886.v44cf5e4ecec5 and earlier",
