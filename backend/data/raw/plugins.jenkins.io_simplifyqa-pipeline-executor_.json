By leveraging APIs, it provides real-time execution updates, status monitoring, and threshold-based control. Features Trigger Pipeline Execution: Starts a pipeline execution using the provided API details. Real-Time Status Updates: Polls the pipeline status every 5 seconds to monitor progress. Threshold Monitoring: Automatically stops the execution if the failure rate exceeds the specified threshold. Customizable Parameters: Supports user-defined API URL, API Key, Pipeline ID, and execution threshold. Parameters This plugin requires the following parameters during the build: Parameter Description Example API URL The base URL of the API used to trigger the pipeline. https://api.example.com API Key The authentication key for API access. abc123xyz Pipeline ID The identifier for the pipeline to be executed. pipeline-001 Threshold The maximum allowed failure percentage before stopping the pipeline. 20 Workflow Start Pipeline Execution: The plugin initiates a pipeline execution by calling the API's start endpoint with the provided parameters. Logs the initiation details in the Jenkins console. Fetch Status Periodically: Every 5 seconds, the plugin queries the pipeline status. Logs detailed execution updates, including progress and error rates. Threshold Monitoring: Stops the pipeline if the failure percentage exceeds the specified threshold. Marks the build as FAILED if the pipeline fails or exceeds the threshold. Completion Handling: If the pipeline completes successfully, the build is marked as SUCCESS. Setup and Usage This plugin requires the following environment variables to be set in your Jenkins build job: API URL: The URL of your SimplifyQA API (e.g., https://api.simplifyqa.com). API Key: The API key for authenticating with the SimplifyQA API. Pipeline ID: The unique ID of the pipeline to be executed. Threshold: The threshold for failure percentage (e.g., 80.0 for 80%). When the Build Now button is clicked, the plugin will: Trigger the pipeline execution. Poll the status every 5 seconds. Check if the failure percentage exceeds the threshold. Stop the execution if the threshold is reached or the execution fails. Install the Plugin Install the plugin via the Jenkins Plugin Manager.
