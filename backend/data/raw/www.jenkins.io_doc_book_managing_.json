In this chapter, we look at these screens and explain how to use them. The tiles displayed on the Manage Jenkins page are grouped logically. Here we discuss the pages that are part of the standard installation. Plugins may add pages to this screen. The top of the Manage Jenkins screen may contain \"Monitors\" that alert you when a new version of the Jenkins software or a security update is available. Each monitor includes a description of the issue it is reporting and links to additional information about the issue Inline help is available on most Manage Jenkins pages: To access the help, select the ? icon to the right of each field. Click the ? icon again to hide the help text. Other system administration topics are discussed in Jenkins System Administration. System Configuration group Screens for configuring resources for your Jenkins controller. System Configure global settings and paths for the Jenkins controller Tools Configure tools, their locations, and automatic installers Plugins Add, update, remove, disable/enable plugins that extend the functionality of Jenkins. Nodes and Clouds Add, remove, control, and monitor the nodes used for the agents on which build jobs run. Configuration as Code Configure your Jenkins controller using a human-readable YAML file rather than the UI. This is an optional feature that appears in this group only when the plugin is installed on your controller. Security group Screens for configuring security features for your Jenkins controller. See Securing Jenkins for general information about managing Jenkins security. Security Set configuration parameters that secure your Jenkins controller. Manage Credentials Configure the credentials that provide secure access to third-party sites and applications that interact with Jenkins. Credential Providers Configure credential providers and types Users Manage users defined in the Jenkins user database. This is not used if you use a different security realm such as LDAP or AD. Status Information group System Information Displays information about the Jenkins environment. System Log Jenkins log that contains all java.util.logging output related to Jenkins. Load Statistics Displays information about resource utilization on you Jenkins controller. About Jenkins Provides version and license information for your Jenkins controller. Troubleshooting group Manage Old Data Remove configuration information related to plugins that have been removed from the controller. Tools and Actions group Screens for common management tasks and management tools that enable you to do administrative tasks without using the UI. Reload Configuration from Disk Discard all data that is loaded in memory and reload everything from the file system. This is useful when you modify configuration files directly on disk. Jenkins CLI How to use the Jenkins CLI from a shell or script. Script Console Execute an Apache Groovy script for administration, troubleshooting, and diagnostics. Prepare for Shutdown Prevents new builds from starting so that the system can be shut down safely. Displays a red banner with a custom message so that users know what is about to happen. This does not ask Jenkins to stop; this action will just prevent new builds from starting. If you need to stop or restart Jenkins, you should use the command line or the /restart and /safeRestart end points. There is also a plugin called Safe Restart that will add a Restart Safely link in the UI. Uncategorized group Screens for plugins that have not yet declared the category of their page. \u00e2\u0087\u0090 Blue Ocean Index Configuring the System \u00e2\u0087\u0092 Was this page helpful?
