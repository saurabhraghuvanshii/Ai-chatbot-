For more information on how to use Pipeline syntax in practical examples, refer to the Using a Jenkinsfile section of this chapter. As of version 2.5 of the Pipeline plugin, Pipeline supports two discrete syntaxes which are detailed below. For the pros and cons of each, refer to the Syntax Comparison. As discussed at the start of this chapter, the most fundamental part of a Pipeline is the \"step\". Basically, steps tell Jenkins what to do and serve as the basic building block for both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline syntax. For an overview of available steps, please refer to the Pipeline Steps reference which contains a comprehensive list of steps built into Pipeline as well as steps provided by plugins. Declarative Pipeline Declarative Pipeline presents a more simplified and opinionated syntax on top of the Pipeline sub-systems. In order to use them, install the Pipeline: Declarative Plugin. All valid Declarative Pipelines must be enclosed within a pipeline block, for example: pipeline { /* insert Declarative Pipeline here */ } The basic statements and expressions which are valid in Declarative Pipeline follow the same rules as Groovy\u2019s syntax with the following exceptions: The top-level of the Pipeline must be a block, specifically: pipeline { }. No semicolons as statement separators. Each statement has to be on its own line. Blocks must only consist of Sections, Directives, Steps, or assignment statements. A property reference statement is treated as a no-argument method invocation. So, for example, input is treated as input(). You can use the Declarative Directive Generator to help you get started with configuring the directives and sections in your Declarative Pipeline. Limitations There is currently an open issue which limits the maximum size of the code within the pipeline{} block. This limitation does not apply to Scripted Pipelines. Sections Sections in Declarative Pipeline typically contain one or more Directives or Steps. agent The agent section specifies where the entire Pipeline, or a specific stage, will execute in the Jenkins environment depending on where the agent section is placed. The section must be defined at the top-level inside the pipeline block, but stage-level usage is optional. Required Yes Parameters Described below Allowed In the top-level pipeline block and each stage block. Differences between top level agents and stage level agents There are some nuances when adding an agent to the top level or a stage level when the options directive is applied. Check the section options for more information. Top Level Agents In agents declared at the top level of a Pipeline, an agent is allocated and then the timeout option is applied. The time to allocate the agent is not included in the limit set by the timeout option. pipeline { agent any options { // Timeout counter starts AFTER agent is allocated timeout(time: 1, unit: 'SECONDS') } stages { stage('Example') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } } } Stage Agents In agents declared within a stage, the options are invoked before allocating the agent and before checking any when conditions. In this case, when using timeout, it is applied before the agent is allocated. The time to allocate the agent is included in the limit set by the timeout option. pipeline { agent none stages { stage('Example') { agent any options { // Timeout counter starts BEFORE agent is allocated timeout(time: 1, unit: 'SECONDS') } steps { echo 'Hello World' } } } } This timeout will include the agent provisioning time. Because the timeout includes the agent provisioning time, the Pipeline may fail in cases where agent allocation is delayed. Parameters In order to support the wide variety of use-cases Pipeline authors may have, the agent section supports a few different types of parameters. These parameters can be applied at the top-level of the pipeline block, or within each stage directive. any Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on any available agent. For example: agent any none When applied at the top-level of the pipeline block no global agent will be allocated for the entire Pipeline run and each stage section will need to contain its own agent section. For example: agent none label Execute the Pipeline, or stage, on an agent available in the Jenkins environment with the provided label. For example: agent { label 'my-defined-label' } Label conditions can also be used: For example: agent { label 'my-label1 && my-label2' } or agent { label 'my-label1 || my-label2' } node agent { node { label 'labelName' } } behaves the same as agent { label 'labelName' }, but node allows for additional options (such as customWorkspace). docker Execute the Pipeline, or stage, with the given container which will be dynamically provisioned on a node pre-configured to accept Docker-based Pipelines, or on a node matching the optionally defined label parameter. docker also optionally accepts an args parameter which may contain arguments to pass directly to a docker run invocation, and an alwaysPull option, which will force a docker pull even if the image name is already present. For example: agent { docker 'maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17' } or agent { docker { image 'maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17' label 'my-defined-label' args '-v /tmp:/tmp' } } docker also optionally accepts a registryUrl and registryCredentialsId parameters which will help to specify the Docker Registry to use and its credentials. The parameter registryCredentialsId could be used alone for private repositories within the docker hub. For example: agent { docker { image 'myregistry.com/node' label 'my-defined-label' registryUrl 'https://myregistry.com/' registryCredentialsId 'myPredefinedCredentialsInJenkins' } } dockerfile Execute the Pipeline, or stage, with a container built from a Dockerfile contained in the source repository. In order to use this option, the Jenkinsfile must be loaded from either a Multibranch Pipeline or a Pipeline from SCM. Conventionally this is the Dockerfile in the root of the source repository: agent { dockerfile true }. If building a Dockerfile in another directory, use the dir option: agent { dockerfile { dir 'someSubDir' } }. If your Dockerfile has another name, you can specify the file name with the filename option. You can pass additional arguments to the docker build \u2026\u200b command with the additionalBuildArgs option, like agent { dockerfile { additionalBuildArgs '--build-arg foo=bar' } }. For example, a repository with the file build/Dockerfile.build, expecting a build argument version: agent { // Equivalent to \"docker build -f Dockerfile.build --build-arg version=1.0.2 ./build/ dockerfile { filename 'Dockerfile.build' dir 'build' label 'my-defined-label' additionalBuildArgs '--build-arg version=1.0.2' args '-v /tmp:/tmp' } } dockerfile also optionally accepts a registryUrl and registryCredentialsId parameters which will help to specify the Docker Registry to use and its credentials. For example: agent { dockerfile { filename 'Dockerfile.build' dir 'build' label 'my-defined-label' registryUrl 'https://myregistry.com/' registryCredentialsId 'myPredefinedCredentialsInJenkins' } } kubernetes Execute the Pipeline, or stage, inside a pod deployed on a Kubernetes cluster. In order to use this option, the Jenkinsfile must be loaded from either a Multibranch Pipeline or a Pipeline from SCM. The Pod template is defined inside the kubernetes { } block. For example, if you want a pod with a Kaniko container inside it, you would define it as follows: agent { kubernetes { defaultContainer 'kaniko' yaml ''' kind: Pod spec: containers: - name: kaniko image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:debug imagePullPolicy: Always command: - sleep args: - 99d volumeMounts: - name: aws-secret mountPath: /root/.aws/ - name: docker-registry-config mountPath: /kaniko/.docker volumes: - name: aws-secret secret: secretName: aws-secret - name: docker-registry-config configMap: name: docker-registry-config ''' } You will need to create a secret aws-secret for Kaniko to be able to authenticate with ECR. This secret should contain the contents of ~/.aws/credentials. The other volume is a ConfigMap which should contain the endpoint of your ECR registry. For example: { \"credHelpers\": { \"<your-aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com\": \"ecr-login\" } } Refer to the following example for reference: https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/blob/master/examples/kaniko.groovy Common Options These are a few options that can be applied to two or more agent implementations. They are not required unless explicitly stated. label A string. The label or label condition on which to run the Pipeline or individual stage. This option is valid for node, docker, and dockerfile, and is required for node. customWorkspace A string. Run the Pipeline or individual stage this agent is applied to within this custom workspace, rather than the default. It can be either a relative path, in which case the custom workspace will be under the workspace root on the node, or an absolute path. For example: agent { node { label 'my-defined-label' customWorkspace '/some/other/path' } } This option is valid for node, docker, and dockerfile. reuseNode A boolean, false by default. If true, run the container on the node specified at the top-level of the Pipeline, in the same workspace, rather than on a new node entirely. This option is valid for docker and dockerfile, and only has an effect when used on an agent for an individual stage. args A string. Runtime arguments to pass to docker run. This option is valid for docker and dockerfile. Example 1. Docker Agent, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent { docker 'maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17' } (1) stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { sh 'mvn -B clean verify' } } } } 1 Execute all the steps defined in this Pipeline within a newly created container of the given name and tag (maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17). Example 2. Stage-level Agent Section pipeline { agent none (1) stages { stage('Example Build') { agent { docker 'maven:3.9.3-eclipse-temurin-17' } (2) steps { echo 'Hello, Maven' sh 'mvn --version' } } stage('Example Test') { agent { docker 'openjdk:17-jre' } (3) steps { echo 'Hello, JDK' sh 'java -version' } } } } 1 Defining agent none at the top-level of the Pipeline ensures that an Executor will not be assigned unnecessarily. Using agent none also forces each stage section to contain its own agent section. 2 Execute the steps in this stage in a newly created container using this image. 3 Execute the steps in this stage in a newly created container using a different image from the previous stage. post The post section defines one or more additional steps that are run upon the completion of a Pipeline\u2019s or stage\u2019s run (depending on the location of the post section within the Pipeline). post can support any of the following post-condition blocks: always, changed, fixed, regression, aborted, failure, success, unstable, unsuccessful, and cleanup. These condition blocks allow the execution of steps inside each condition depending on the completion status of the Pipeline or stage. The condition blocks are executed in the order shown below. Required No Parameters None Allowed In the top-level pipeline block and each stage block. Conditions always Run the steps in the post section regardless of the completion status of the Pipeline\u2019s or stage\u2019s run. changed Only run the steps in post if the current Pipeline\u2019s run has a different completion status from its previous run. fixed Only run the steps in post if the current Pipeline\u2019s run is successful and the previous run failed or was unstable. regression Only run the steps in post if the current Pipeline\u2019s or status is failure, unstable, or aborted and the previous run was successful. aborted Only run the steps in post if the current Pipeline\u2019s run has an \"aborted\" status, usually due to the Pipeline being manually aborted. This is typically denoted by gray in the web UI. failure Only run the steps in post if the current Pipeline\u2019s or stage\u2019s run has a \"failed\" status, typically denoted by red in the web UI. success Only run the steps in post if the current Pipeline\u2019s or stage\u2019s run has a \"success\" status, typically denoted by blue or green in the web UI. unstable Only run the steps in post if the current Pipeline\u2019s run has an \"unstable\" status, usually caused by test failures, code violations, etc. This is typically denoted by yellow in the web UI. unsuccessful Only run the steps in post if the current Pipeline\u2019s or stage\u2019s run has not a \"success\" status. This is typically denoted in the web UI depending on the status previously mentioned (for stages this may fire if the build itself is unstable). cleanup Run the steps in this post condition after every other post condition has been evaluated, regardless of the Pipeline or stage\u2019s status. Example 3. Post Section, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } } post { (1) always { (2) echo 'I will always say Hello again!' } } } 1 Conventionally, the post section should be placed at the end of the Pipeline. 2 Post-condition blocks contain steps the same as the steps section. stages Containing a sequence of one or more stage directives, the stages section is where the bulk of the \"work\" described by a Pipeline will be located. At a minimum, it is recommended that stages contain at least one stage directive for each discrete part of the continuous delivery process, such as Build, Test, and Deploy. Required Yes Parameters None Allowed Inside the pipeline block, or within a stage. Example 4. Stages, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { (1) stage('Example') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } } } 1 The stages section will typically follow the directives such as agent, options, etc. steps The steps section defines a series of one or more steps to be executed in a given stage directive. Required Yes Parameters None Allowed Inside each stage block. Example 5. Single Step, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { steps { (1) echo 'Hello World' } } } } 1 The steps section must contain one or more steps. Directives environment The environment directive specifies a sequence of key-value pairs which will be defined as environment variables for all steps, or stage-specific steps, depending on where the environment directive is located within the Pipeline. This directive supports a special helper method credentials() which can be used to access pre-defined Credentials by their identifier in the Jenkins environment. Required No Parameters None Allowed Inside the pipeline block, or within stage directives. Supported Credentials Type Secret Text The environment variable specified will be set to the Secret Text content. Secret File The environment variable specified will be set to the location of the File file that is temporarily created. Username and password The environment variable specified will be set to username:password and two additional environment variables will be automatically defined: MYVARNAME_USR and MYVARNAME_PSW respectively. SSH with Private Key The environment variable specified will be set to the location of the SSH key file that is temporarily created and two additional environment variables will be automatically defined: MYVARNAME_USR and MYVARNAME_PSW (holding the passphrase). Unsupported credentials type causes the pipeline to fail with the message: org.jenkinsci.plugins.credentialsbinding.impl.CredentialNotFoundException: No suitable binding handler could be found for type <unsupportedType>. Example 6. Secret Text Credentials, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any environment { (1) CC = 'clang' } stages { stage('Example') { environment { (2) AN_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('my-predefined-secret-text') (3) } steps { sh 'printenv' } } } } 1 An environment directive used in the top-level pipeline block will apply to all steps within the Pipeline. 2 An environment directive defined within a stage will only apply the given environment variables to steps within the stage. 3 The environment block has a helper method credentials() defined which can be used to access pre-defined Credentials by their identifier in the Jenkins environment. Example 7. Username and Password Credentials pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example Username/Password') { environment { SERVICE_CREDS = credentials('my-predefined-username-password') } steps { sh 'echo \"Service user is $SERVICE_CREDS_USR\"' sh 'echo \"Service password is $SERVICE_CREDS_PSW\"' sh 'curl -u $SERVICE_CREDS https://myservice.example.com' } } stage('Example SSH Username with private key') { environment { SSH_CREDS = credentials('my-predefined-ssh-creds') } steps { sh 'echo \"SSH private key is located at $SSH_CREDS\"' sh 'echo \"SSH user is $SSH_CREDS_USR\"' sh 'echo \"SSH passphrase is $SSH_CREDS_PSW\"' } } } } options The options directive allows configuring Pipeline-specific options from within the Pipeline itself. Pipeline provides a number of these options, such as buildDiscarder, but they may also be provided by plugins, such as timestamps. Required No Parameters None Allowed Inside the pipeline block, or (with certain limitations) within stage directives. Available Options buildDiscarder Persist artifacts and console output for the specific number of recent Pipeline runs. For example: options { buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr: '1')) } checkoutToSubdirectory Perform the automatic source control checkout in a subdirectory of the workspace. For example: options { checkoutToSubdirectory('foo') } disableConcurrentBuilds Disallow concurrent executions of the Pipeline. Can be useful for preventing simultaneous accesses to shared resources, etc. For example: options { disableConcurrentBuilds() } to queue a build when there\u2019s already an executing build of the Pipeline, or options { disableConcurrentBuilds(abortPrevious: true) } to abort the running one and start the new build. disableResume Do not allow the pipeline to resume if the controller restarts. For example: options { disableResume() } newContainerPerStage Used with docker or dockerfile top-level agent. When specified, each stage will run in a new container deployed on the same node, rather than all stages running in the same container deployment. overrideIndexTriggers Allows overriding default treatment of branch indexing triggers. If branch indexing triggers are disabled at the multibranch or organization label, options { overrideIndexTriggers(true) } will enable them for this job only. Otherwise, options { overrideIndexTriggers(false) } will disable branch indexing triggers for this job only. preserveStashes Preserve stashes from completed builds, for use with stage restarting. For example: options { preserveStashes() } to preserve the stashes from the most recent completed build, or options { preserveStashes(buildCount: 5) } to preserve the stashes from the five most recent completed builds. quietPeriod Set the quiet period, in seconds, for the Pipeline, overriding the global default. For example: options { quietPeriod(30) } retry On failure, retry the entire Pipeline the specified number of times. For example: options { retry(3) } skipDefaultCheckout Skip checking out code from source control by default in the agent directive. For example: options { skipDefaultCheckout() } skipStagesAfterUnstable Skip stages once the build status has gone to UNSTABLE. For example: options { skipStagesAfterUnstable() } timeout Set a timeout period for the Pipeline run, after which Jenkins should abort the Pipeline. For example: options { timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') } Example 8. Global Timeout, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any options { timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') (1) } stages { stage('Example') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } } } 1 Specifying a global execution timeout of one hour, after which Jenkins will abort the Pipeline run. timestamps Prepend all console output generated by the Pipeline run with the time at which the line was emitted. For example: options { timestamps() } parallelsAlwaysFailFast Set failfast true for all subsequent parallel stages in the pipeline. For example: options { parallelsAlwaysFailFast() } disableRestartFromStage Completely disable option \"Restart From Stage\" visible in classic Jenkins UI and Blue Ocean as well. For example: options { disableRestartFromStage() }. This option can not be used inside of the stage. A comprehensive list of available options is pending the completion of help desk ticket 820. stage options The options directive for a stage is similar to the options directive at the root of the Pipeline. However, the stage-level options can only contain steps like retry, timeout, or timestamps, or Declarative options that are relevant to a stage, like skipDefaultCheckout. Inside a stage, the steps in the options directive are invoked before entering the agent or checking any when conditions. Available Stage Options skipDefaultCheckout Skip checking out code from source control by default in the agent directive. For example: options { skipDefaultCheckout() } timeout Set a timeout period for this stage, after which Jenkins should abort the stage. For example: options { timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') } Example 9. Stage Timeout, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { options { timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') (1) } steps { echo 'Hello World' } } } } 1 Specifying an execution timeout of one hour for the Example stage, after which Jenkins will abort the Pipeline run. retry On failure, retry this stage the specified number of times. For example: options { retry(3) } timestamps Prepend all console output generated during this stage with the time at which the line was emitted. For example: options { timestamps() } parameters The parameters directive provides a list of parameters that a user should provide when triggering the Pipeline. The values for these user-specified parameters are made available to Pipeline steps via the params object, refer to the Parameters, Declarative Pipeline for its specific usage. Each parameter has a Name and Value, depending on the parameter type. This information is exported as environment variables when the build starts, allowing subsequent parts of the build configuration to access those values. For example, use the ${PARAMETER_NAME} syntax with POSIX shells like bash and ksh, the ${Env:PARAMETER_NAME} syntax with PowerShell, or the %PARAMETER_NAME% syntax with Windows cmd.exe. Required No Parameters None Allowed Only once, inside the pipeline block. Available Parameters string A parameter of a string type, for example: parameters { string(name: 'DEPLOY_ENV', defaultValue: 'staging', description: '') }. text A text parameter, which can contain multiple lines, for example: parameters { text(name: 'DEPLOY_TEXT', defaultValue: 'One\\nTwo\\nThree\\n', description: '') }. booleanParam A boolean parameter, for example: parameters { booleanParam(name: 'DEBUG_BUILD', defaultValue: true, description: '') }. choice A choice parameter, for example: parameters { choice(name: 'CHOICES', choices: ['one', 'two', 'three'], description: '') }. The first value is the default. password A password parameter, for example: parameters { password(name: 'PASSWORD', defaultValue: 'SECRET', description: 'A secret password') }. Example 10. Parameters, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any parameters { string(name: 'PERSON', defaultValue: 'Mr Jenkins', description: 'Who should I say hello to?') text(name: 'BIOGRAPHY', defaultValue: '', description: 'Enter some information about the person') booleanParam(name: 'TOGGLE', defaultValue: true, description: 'Toggle this value') choice(name: 'CHOICE', choices: ['One', 'Two', 'Three'], description: 'Pick something') password(name: 'PASSWORD', defaultValue: 'SECRET', description: 'Enter a password') } stages { stage('Example') { steps { echo \"Hello ${params.PERSON}\" echo \"Biography: ${params.BIOGRAPHY}\" echo \"Toggle: ${params.TOGGLE}\" echo \"Choice: ${params.CHOICE}\" echo \"Password: ${params.PASSWORD}\" } } } } A comprehensive list of available parameters is pending the completion of help desk ticket 820. triggers The triggers directive defines the automated ways in which the Pipeline should be re-triggered. For Pipelines which are integrated with a source such as GitHub or BitBucket, triggers may not be necessary as webhooks-based integration will likely already be present. The triggers currently available are cron, pollSCM and upstream. Required No Parameters None Allowed Only once, inside the pipeline block. cron Accepts a cron-style string to define a regular interval at which the Pipeline should be re-triggered, for example: triggers { cron('H */4 * * 1-5') }. pollSCM Accepts a cron-style string to define a regular interval at which Jenkins should check for new source changes. If new changes exist, the Pipeline will be re-triggered. For example: triggers { pollSCM('H */4 * * 1-5') } upstream Accepts a comma-separated string of jobs and a threshold. When any job in the string finishes with the minimum threshold, the Pipeline will be re-triggered. For example: triggers { upstream(upstreamProjects: 'job1,job2', threshold: hudson.model.Result.SUCCESS) } The pollSCM trigger is only available in Jenkins 2.22 or later. Example 11. Triggers, Declarative Pipeline // Declarative // pipeline { agent any triggers { cron('H */4 * * 1-5') } stages { stage('Example') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } } } Jenkins cron syntax The Jenkins cron syntax follows the syntax of the cron utility (with minor differences). Specifically, each line consists of 5 fields separated by TAB or whitespace: MINUTE HOUR DOM MONTH DOW Minutes within the hour (0\u00e2\u0080\u009359) The hour of the day (0\u00e2\u0080\u009323) The day of the month (1\u00e2\u0080\u009331) The month (1\u00e2\u0080\u009312) The day of the week (0\u00e2\u0080\u00937) where 0 and 7 are Sunday. To specify multiple values for one field, the following operators are available. In the order of precedence, * specifies all valid values M-N specifies a range of values M-N/X or */X steps by intervals of X through the specified range or whole valid range A,B,\u2026\u200b,Z enumerates multiple values To allow periodically scheduled tasks to produce even load on the system, the symbol H (for \u00e2\u0080\u009chash\u00e2\u0080\u009d) should be used wherever possible. For example, using 0 0 * * * for a dozen daily jobs will cause a large spike at midnight. In contrast, using H H * * * would still execute each job once a day, but not all at the same time, better using limited resources. The H symbol can be used with a range. For example, H H(0-7) * * * means some time between 12:00 AM (midnight) to 7:59 AM. You can also use step intervals with H, with or without ranges. The H symbol can be thought of as a random value over a range, but it actually is a hash of the job name, not a random function, so that the value remains stable for any given project. Beware that for the day of month field, short cycles such as */3 or H/3 will not work consistently near the end of most months, due to variable month lengths. For example, */3 will run on the 1st, 4th, \u00e2\u0080\u00a631st days of a long month, then again the next day of the next month. Hashes are always chosen in the 1-28 range, so H/3 will produce a gap between runs of between 3 and 6 days at the end of a month. Longer cycles will also have inconsistent lengths, but the effect may be relatively less noticeable. Empty lines and lines that start with # will be ignored as comments. In addition, @yearly, @annually, @monthly, @weekly, @daily, @midnight, and @hourly are supported as convenient aliases. These use the hash system for automatic balancing. For example, @hourly is the same as H * * * * and could mean at any time during the hour. @midnight actually means some time between 12:00 AM and 2:59 AM. Table 1. Jenkins cron syntax examples every fifteen minutes (perhaps at :07, :22, :37, :52) triggers{ cron('H/15 * * * *') } every ten minutes in the first half of every hour (three times, perhaps at :04, :14, :24) triggers{ cron('H(0-29)/10 * * * *') } once every two hours at 45 minutes past the hour starting at 9:45 AM and finishing at 3:45 PM every weekday. triggers{ cron('45 9-16/2 * * 1-5') } once in every two hours slot between 9 AM and 5 PM every weekday (perhaps at 10:38 AM, 12:38 PM, 2:38 PM, 4:38 PM) triggers{ cron('H H(9-16)/2 * * 1-5') } once a day on the 1st and 15th of every month except December triggers{ cron('H H 1,15 1-11 *') } stage The stage directive goes in the stages section and should contain a steps section, an optional agent section, or other stage-specific directives. Practically speaking, all of the real work done by a Pipeline will be wrapped in one or more stage directives. Required At least one Parameters One mandatory parameter, a string for the name of the stage. Allowed Inside the stages section. Example 12. Stage, Declarative Pipeline // Declarative // pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } } } tools A section defining tools to auto-install and put on the PATH. This is ignored if agent none is specified. Required No Parameters None Allowed Inside the pipeline block or a stage block. Supported Tools maven jdk gradle Example 13. Tools, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any tools { maven 'apache-maven-3.0.1' (1) } stages { stage('Example') { steps { sh 'mvn --version' } } } } 1 The tool name must be pre-configured in Jenkins under Manage Jenkins \u2192 Tools. input The input directive on a stage allows you to prompt for input, using the input step. The stage will pause after any options have been applied, and before entering the agent block for that stage or evaluating the when condition of the stage. If the input is approved, the stage will then continue. Any parameters provided as part of the input submission will be available in the environment for the rest of the stage. Configuration options message Required. This will be presented to the user when they go to submit the input. id An optional identifier for this input. The default value is based on the stage name. ok Optional text for the \"ok\" button on the input form. submitter An optional comma-separated list of users or external group names who are allowed to submit this input. Defaults to allowing any user. submitterParameter An optional name of an environment variable to set with the submitter name, if present. parameters An optional list of parameters to prompt the submitter to provide. Refer to parameters for more information. Example 14. Input Step, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { input { message \"Should we continue?\" ok \"Yes, we should.\" submitter \"alice,bob\" parameters { string(name: 'PERSON', defaultValue: 'Mr Jenkins', description: 'Who should I say hello to?') } } steps { echo \"Hello, ${PERSON}, nice to meet you.\" } } } } when The when directive allows the Pipeline to determine whether the stage should be executed depending on the given condition. The when directive must contain at least one condition. If the when directive contains more than one condition, all the child conditions must return true for the stage to execute. This is the same as if the child conditions were nested in an allOf condition (refer to the examples below). If an anyOf condition is used, note that the condition skips remaining tests as soon as the first \"true\" condition is found. More complex conditional structures can be built using the nesting conditions: not, allOf, or anyOf. Nesting conditions may be nested to any arbitrary depth. Required No Parameters None Allowed Inside a stage directive Built-in Conditions branch Execute the stage when the branch being built matches the branch pattern (ANT style path glob) given, for example: when { branch 'master' }. Note that this only works on a multibranch Pipeline. The optional parameter comparator may be added after an attribute to specify how any patterns are evaluated for a match: EQUALS for a simple string comparison GLOB (the default) for an ANT style path glob (same as for example changeset) REGEXP for regular expression matching For example: when { branch pattern: \"release-\\\\d+\", comparator: \"REGEXP\"} buildingTag Execute the stage when the build is building a tag. For example: when { buildingTag() } changelog Execute the stage if the build\u2019s SCM changelog contains a given regular expression pattern, for example: when { changelog '.*^\\\\[DEPENDENCY\\\\] .+$' }. changeset Execute the stage if the build\u2019s SCM changeset contains one or more files matching the given pattern. Example: when { changeset \"**/*.js\" } The optional parameter comparator may be added after an attribute to specify how any patterns are evaluated for a match: EQUALS for a simple string comparison GLOB (the default) for an ANT style path glob case insensitive (this can be turned off with the caseSensitive parameter). REGEXP for regular expression matching For example: when { changeset pattern: \".TEST\\\\.java\", comparator: \"REGEXP\" } or when { changeset pattern: \"*/*TEST.java\", caseSensitive: true } changeRequest Executes the stage if the current build is for a \"change request\" (a.k.a. Pull Request on GitHub and Bitbucket, Merge Request on GitLab, Change in Gerrit, etc.). When no parameters are passed the stage runs on every change request, for example: when { changeRequest() }. By adding a filter attribute with parameter to the change request, the stage can be made to run only on matching change requests. Possible attributes are id, target, branch, fork, url, title, author, authorDisplayName, and authorEmail. Each of these corresponds to a CHANGE_* environment variable, for example: when { changeRequest target: 'master' }. The optional parameter comparator may be added after an attribute to specify how any patterns are evaluated for a match: EQUALS for a simple string comparison (the default) GLOB for an ANT style path glob (same as for example changeset) REGEXP for regular expression matching Example: when { changeRequest authorEmail: \"[\\\\w_-.]+@example.com\", comparator: 'REGEXP' } environment Execute the stage when the specified environment variable is set to the given value, for example: when { environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'production' }. equals Execute the stage when the expected value is equal to the actual value, for example: when { equals expected: 2, actual: currentBuild.number }. expression Execute the stage when the specified Groovy expression evaluates to true, for example: when { expression { return params.DEBUG_BUILD } }. When returning strings from your expressions they must be converted to booleans or return null to evaluate to false. Simply returning \"0\" or \"false\" will still evaluate to \"true\". tag Execute the stage if the TAG_NAME variable matches the given pattern. For example: when { tag \"release-*\" } If an empty pattern is provided the stage will execute if the TAG_NAME variable exists (same as buildingTag()). The optional parameter comparator may be added after an attribute to specify how any patterns are evaluated for a match: EQUALS for a simple string comparison, GLOB (the default) for an ANT style path glob (same as for example changeset), or REGEXP for regular expression matching. For example: when { tag pattern: \"release-\\\\d+\", comparator: \"REGEXP\"} not Execute the stage when the nested condition is false. Must contain one condition. For example: when { not { branch 'master' } } allOf Execute the stage when all of the nested conditions are true. Must contain at least one condition. For example: when { allOf { branch 'master'; environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'production' } } anyOf Execute the stage when at least one of the nested conditions is true. Must contain at least one condition. For example: when { anyOf { branch 'master'; branch 'staging' } } triggeredBy Execute the stage when the current build has been triggered by the param given. For example: when { triggeredBy 'SCMTrigger' } when { triggeredBy 'TimerTrigger' } when { triggeredBy 'BuildUpstreamCause' } when { triggeredBy cause: \"UserIdCause\", detail: \"vlinde\" } Evaluating when before entering agent in a stage By default, the when condition for a stage will be evaluated after entering the agent for that stage, if one is defined. However, this can be changed by specifying the beforeAgent option within the when block. If beforeAgent is set to true, the when condition will be evaluated first, and the agent will only be entered if the when condition evaluates to true. Evaluating when before the input directive By default, the when condition for a stage will not be evaluated before the input, if one is defined. However, this can be changed by specifying the beforeInput option within the when block. If beforeInput is set to true, the when condition will be evaluated first, and the input will only be entered if the when condition evaluates to true. beforeInput true takes precedence over beforeAgent true. Evaluating when before the options directive By default, the when condition for a stage will be evaluated after entering the options for that stage, if any are defined. However, this can be changed by specifying the beforeOptions option within the when block. If beforeOptions is set to true, the when condition will be evaluated first, and the options will only be entered if the when condition evaluates to true. beforeOptions true takes precedence over beforeInput true and beforeAgent true. Example 15. Single Condition, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { when { branch 'production' } steps { echo 'Deploying' } } } } Example 16. Multiple Condition, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { when { branch 'production' environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'production' } steps { echo 'Deploying' } } } } Example 17. Nested condition (same behavior as previous example) pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { when { allOf { branch 'production' environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'production' } } steps { echo 'Deploying' } } } } Example 18. Multiple condition and nested condition pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { when { branch 'production' anyOf { environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'production' environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'staging' } } steps { echo 'Deploying' } } } } Example 19. Expression condition and nested condition pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { when { expression { BRANCH_NAME ==~ /(production|staging)/ } anyOf { environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'production' environment name: 'DEPLOY_TO', value: 'staging' } } steps { echo 'Deploying' } } } } Example 20. beforeAgent pipeline { agent none stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { agent { label \"some-label\" } when { beforeAgent true branch 'production' } steps { echo 'Deploying' } } } } Example 21. beforeInput pipeline { agent none stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { when { beforeInput true branch 'production' } input { message \"Deploy to production?\" id \"simple-input\" } steps { echo 'Deploying' } } } } Example 22. beforeOptions pipeline { agent none stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { when { beforeOptions true branch 'testing' } options { lock label: 'testing-deploy-envs', quantity: 1, variable: 'deployEnv' } steps { echo \"Deploying to ${deployEnv}\" } } } } Example 23. triggeredBy pipeline { agent none stages { stage('Example Build') { steps { echo 'Hello World' } } stage('Example Deploy') { when { triggeredBy \"TimerTrigger\" } steps { echo 'Deploying' } } } } Sequential Stages Stages in Declarative Pipeline may have a stages section containing a list of nested stages to be run in sequential order. A stage must have one and only one of steps, stages, parallel, or matrix. It is not possible to nest a parallel or matrix block within a stage directive if that stage directive is nested within a parallel or matrix block itself. However, a stage directive within a parallel or matrix block can use all other functionality of a stage, including agent, tools, when, etc. Example 24. Sequential Stages, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent none stages { stage('Non-Sequential Stage') { agent { label 'for-non-sequential' } steps { echo \"On Non-Sequential Stage\" } } stage('Sequential') { agent { label 'for-sequential' } environment { FOR_SEQUENTIAL = \"some-value\" } stages { stage('In Sequential 1') { steps { echo \"In Sequential 1\" } } stage('In Sequential 2') { steps { echo \"In Sequential 2\" } } stage('Parallel In Sequential') { parallel { stage('In Parallel 1') { steps { echo \"In Parallel 1\" } } stage('In Parallel 2') { steps { echo \"In Parallel 2\" } } } } } } } } Parallel Stages in Declarative Pipeline may have a parallel section containing a list of nested stages to be run in parallel. A stage must have one and only one of steps, stages, parallel, or matrix. It is not possible to nest a parallel or matrix block within a stage directive if that stage directive is nested within a parallel or matrix block itself. However, a stage directive within a parallel or matrix block can use all other functionality of a stage, including agent, tools, when, etc. In addition, you can force your parallel stages to all be aborted when any one of them fails, by adding failFast true to the stage containing the parallel. Another option for adding failfast is adding an option to the pipeline definition: parallelsAlwaysFailFast(). Example 25. Parallel Stages, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Non-Parallel Stage') { steps { echo 'This stage will be executed first.' } } stage('Parallel Stage') { when { branch 'master' } failFast true parallel { stage('Branch A') { agent { label \"for-branch-a\" } steps { echo \"On Branch A\" } } stage('Branch B') { agent { label \"for-branch-b\" } steps { echo \"On Branch B\" } } stage('Branch C') { agent { label \"for-branch-c\" } stages { stage('Nested 1') { steps { echo \"In stage Nested 1 within Branch C\" } } stage('Nested 2') { steps { echo \"In stage Nested 2 within Branch C\" } } } } } } } } Example 26. parallelsAlwaysFailFast pipeline { agent any options { parallelsAlwaysFailFast() } stages { stage('Non-Parallel Stage') { steps { echo 'This stage will be executed first.' } } stage('Parallel Stage') { when { branch 'master' } parallel { stage('Branch A') { agent { label \"for-branch-a\" } steps { echo \"On Branch A\" } } stage('Branch B') { agent { label \"for-branch-b\" } steps { echo \"On Branch B\" } } stage('Branch C') { agent { label \"for-branch-c\" } stages { stage('Nested 1') { steps { echo \"In stage Nested 1 within Branch C\" } } stage('Nested 2') { steps { echo \"In stage Nested 2 within Branch C\" } } } } } } } } Matrix Stages in Declarative Pipeline may have a matrix section defining a multi-dimensional matrix of name-value combinations to be run in parallel. We\u2019ll refer these combinations as \"cells\" in a matrix. Each cell in a matrix can include one or more stages to be run sequentially using the configuration for that cell. A stage must have one and only one of steps, stages, parallel, or matrix. It is not possible to nest a parallel or matrix block within a stage directive if that stage directive is nested within a parallel or matrix block itself. However, a stage directive within a parallel or matrix block can use all other functionality of a stage, including agent, tools, when, etc. In addition, you can force your matrix cells to all be aborted when any one of them fails, by adding failFast true to the stage containing the matrix. Another option for adding failfast is adding an option to the pipeline definition: parallelsAlwaysFailFast(). The matrix section must include an axes section and a stages section. The axes section defines the values for each axis in the matrix. The stages section defines a list of stages to run sequentially in each cell. A matrix may have an excludes section to remove invalid cells from the matrix. Many of the directives available on stage, including agent, tools, when, etc., can also be added to matrix to control the behavior of each cell. axes The axes section specifies one or more axis directives. Each axis consists of a name and a list of values. All the values from each axis are combined with the others to produce the cells. Example 27. One-axis with 3 cells matrix { axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows' } } // ... } Example 28. Two-axis with 12 cells (three by four) matrix { axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'chrome', 'edge', 'firefox', 'safari' } } // ... } Example 29. Three-axis matrix with 24 cells (three by four by two) matrix { axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'chrome', 'edge', 'firefox', 'safari' } axis { name 'ARCHITECTURE' values '32-bit', '64-bit' } } // ... } stages The stages section specifies one or more stages to be executed sequentially in each cell. This section is identical to any other stages section. Example 30. One-axis with 3 cells, each cell runs three stages - \"build\", \"test\", and \"deploy\" matrix { axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows' } } stages { stage('build') { // ... } stage('test') { // ... } stage('deploy') { // ... } } } Example 31. Two-axis with 12 cells (three by four) matrix { axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'chrome', 'edge', 'firefox', 'safari' } } stages { stage('build-and-test') { // ... } } } excludes (optional) The optional excludes section lets authors specify one or more exclude filter expressions that select cells to be excluded from the expanded set of matrix cells (aka, sparsening). Filters are constructed using a basic directive structure of one or more of exclude axis directives each with a name and values list. The axis directives inside an exclude generate a set of combinations (similar to generating the matrix cells). The matrix cells that match all the values from an exclude combination are removed from the matrix. If more than one exclude directive is supplied, each is evaluated separately to remove cells. When dealing with a long list of values to exclude, exclude axis directives can use notValues instead of values. These will exclude cells that do not match one of the values passed to notValues. Example 32. Three-axis matrix with 24 cells, exclude '32-bit, mac' (4 cells excluded) matrix { axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'chrome', 'edge', 'firefox', 'safari' } axis { name 'ARCHITECTURE' values '32-bit', '64-bit' } } excludes { exclude { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'mac' } axis { name 'ARCHITECTURE' values '32-bit' } } } // ... } Exclude the linux, safari combination and exclude any platform that is not windows with the edge browser. Example 33. Three-axis matrix with 24 cells, exclude '32-bit, mac' and invalid browser combinations (9 cells excluded) matrix { axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'mac', 'windows' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'chrome', 'edge', 'firefox', 'safari' } axis { name 'ARCHITECTURE' values '32-bit', '64-bit' } } excludes { exclude { // 4 cells axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'mac' } axis { name 'ARCHITECTURE' values '32-bit' } } exclude { // 2 cells axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'safari' } } exclude { // 3 more cells and '32-bit, mac' (already excluded) axis { name 'PLATFORM' notValues 'windows' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'edge' } } } // ... } Matrix cell-level directives (optional) Matrix lets users efficiently configure the overall environment for each cell, by adding stage-level directives under matrix itself. These directives behave the same as they would on a stage but they can also accept values provided by the matrix for each cell. The axis and exclude directives define the static set of cells that make up the matrix. That set of combinations is generated before the start of the pipeline run. The \"per-cell\" directives, on the other hand, are evaluated at runtime. These directives include: agent environment input options post tools when Example 34. Complete Matrix Example, Declarative Pipeline pipeline { parameters { choice(name: 'PLATFORM_FILTER', choices: ['all', 'linux', 'windows', 'mac'], description: 'Run on specific platform') } agent none stages { stage('BuildAndTest') { matrix { agent { label \"${PLATFORM}-agent\" } when { anyOf { expression { params.PLATFORM_FILTER == 'all' } expression { params.PLATFORM_FILTER == env.PLATFORM } } } axes { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux', 'windows', 'mac' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'firefox', 'chrome', 'safari', 'edge' } } excludes { exclude { axis { name 'PLATFORM' values 'linux' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'safari' } } exclude { axis { name 'PLATFORM' notValues 'windows' } axis { name 'BROWSER' values 'edge' } } } stages { stage('Build') { steps { echo \"Do Build for ${PLATFORM} - ${BROWSER}\" } } stage('Test') { steps { echo \"Do Test for ${PLATFORM} - ${BROWSER}\" } } } } } } } Steps Declarative Pipelines may use all the available steps documented in the Pipeline Steps reference, which contains a comprehensive list of steps, with the addition of the steps listed below which are only supported in Declarative Pipeline. script The script step takes a block of Scripted Pipeline and executes that in the Declarative Pipeline. For most use-cases, the script step should be unnecessary in Declarative Pipelines, but it can provide a useful \"escape hatch\". script blocks of non-trivial size and/or complexity should be moved into Shared Libraries instead. Example 35. Script Block in Declarative Pipeline pipeline { agent any stages { stage('Example') { steps { echo 'Hello World' script { def browsers = ['chrome', 'firefox'] for (int i = 0; i < browsers.size(); ++i) { echo \"Testing the ${browsers[i]} browser\" } } } } } } Scripted Pipeline Scripted Pipeline, like Declarative Pipeline, is built on top of the underlying Pipeline sub-system. Unlike Declarative, Scripted Pipeline is effectively a general-purpose DSL [1] built with Groovy. Most functionality provided by the Groovy language is made available to users of Scripted Pipeline, which means it can be a very expressive and flexible tool with which one can author continuous delivery pipelines. Flow Control Scripted Pipeline is serially executed from the top of a Jenkinsfile downwards, like most traditional scripts in Groovy or other languages. Providing flow control, therefore, rests on Groovy expressions, such as the if/else conditionals, for example: Example 36. Conditional Statement if, Scripted Pipeline node { stage('Example') { if (env.BRANCH_NAME == 'master') { echo 'I only execute on the master branch' } else { echo 'I execute elsewhere' } } } Another way Scripted Pipeline flow control can be managed is with Groovy\u2019s exception handling support. When Steps fail for whatever reason they throw an exception. Handling behaviors on-error must make use of the try/catch/finally blocks in Groovy, for example: Example 37. Try-Catch Block, Scripted Pipeline node { stage('Example') { try { sh 'exit 1' } catch (exc) { echo 'Something failed, I should sound the klaxons!' throw } } } Steps As discussed at the start of this chapter, the most fundamental part of a Pipeline is the \"step\". Fundamentally, steps tell Jenkins what to do and serve as the basic building block for both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline syntax. Scripted Pipeline does not introduce any steps which are specific to its syntax; Pipeline Steps reference contains a comprehensive list of steps provided by Pipeline and plugins. Differences from plain Groovy In order to provide durability, which means that running Pipelines can survive a restart of the Jenkins controller, Scripted Pipeline must serialize data back to the controller. Due to this design requirement, some Groovy idioms such as collection.each { item \u2192 /* perform operation */ } are not fully supported. Refer to JENKINS-27421 and JENKINS-26481 for more information. Syntax Comparison This video shares some differences between Scripted and Declarative Pipeline syntax. When Jenkins Pipeline was first created, Groovy was selected as the foundation. Jenkins has long shipped with an embedded Groovy engine to provide advanced scripting capabilities for admins and users alike. Additionally, the implementors of Jenkins Pipeline found Groovy to be a solid foundation upon which to build what is now referred to as the \"Scripted Pipeline\" DSL. [1]. As it is a fully-featured programming environment, Scripted Pipeline offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and extensibility to Jenkins users. The Groovy learning-curve isn\u2019t typically desirable for all members of a given team, so Declarative Pipeline was created to offer a simpler and more opinionated syntax for authoring Jenkins Pipeline. Both are fundamentally the same Pipeline sub-system underneath. They are both durable implementations of \"Pipeline as code\". They are both able to use steps built into Pipeline or provided by plugins. Both are able to utilize Shared Libraries Where they differ however is in syntax and flexibility. Declarative limits what is available to the user with a more strict and pre-defined structure, making it an ideal choice for simpler continuous delivery pipelines. Scripted provides very few limits, insofar that the only limits on structure and syntax tend to be defined by Groovy itself, rather than any Pipeline-specific systems, making it an ideal choice for power-users and those with more complex requirements. As the name implies, Declarative Pipeline encourages a declarative programming model. [2] Whereas Scripted Pipelines follow a more imperative programming model. [3] 1. Domain-specific language 2.
