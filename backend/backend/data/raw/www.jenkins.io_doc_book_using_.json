If you want to create and configure a Pipeline project through a Jenkinsfile or through Blue Ocean, or you wish to find out more about these core Jenkins features, refer to the relevant topics within the respective Pipeline and Blue Ocean chapters. If you are a Jenkins administrator and want to know more about managing Jenkins nodes and instances, see Managing Jenkins. If you are a system administrator and want to learn how to back-up, restore, maintain as Jenkins servers and nodes, see Jenkins System Administration.
