If you want to extend the functionality of Jenkins by developing your own Jenkins plugins, please refer to the Extend Jenkins (developer documentation). What is Jenkins? Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed. About this documentation This documentation begins with a Guided Tour to help you get up and running with Jenkins and introduce you to Jenkins\u2019s main feature, Pipeline. There are also tutorials geared to developers who want to orchestrate and automate building their project in Jenkins using Pipeline and Blue Ocean. If you\u2019ve never used Jenkins before or have limited Jenkins experience, then the Guided Tour and introductory tutorials are good places to start. If you are looking for more detailed information about using Jenkins, please refer to the User Handbook. Documentation scope Jenkins is a highly extensible product whose functionality can be extended through the installation of plugins. There are a vast array of plugins available to Jenkins. However, the documentation covered in the Guided Tour, Tutorials, Solution pages and User Handbook of this documentation are based on a Jenkins installation with the Blue Ocean plugins installed, as well as the \"suggested plugins\", which are specified when running through the Post-installation setup wizard.
