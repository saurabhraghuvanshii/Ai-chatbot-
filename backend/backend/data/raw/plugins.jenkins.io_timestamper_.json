For example: 21:51:15 Started by user anonymous 21:51:15 Building on master 21:51:17 Finished: SUCCESS Getting started Freestyle jobs Enable timestamps within the Build Environment section of the build\u2019s configuration page. To enable timestamps for multiple builds at once, use the Configuration Slicing plugin version 1.32 or later. Pipeline jobs Since Timestamper 1.9 Set the global option to enable timestamps for all Pipeline builds (in Manage Jenkins, Configure System), or use the timestamps step as described below. Since Timestamper 1.8 Use the timestamps step to wrap the rest of the Pipeline script. timestamps { // some block } Since Timestamper 1.7 Prior to Timestamper 1.8, timestamps can only be recorded within a node. node { wrap([$class: 'TimestamperBuildWrapper']) { echo 'hello from Workflow' } } Customization The timestamp format can be configured via the Manage Jenkins, Configure System page. There is a panel on the left-hand side of the console page which allows either the system clock time or the elapsed time to be displayed. The time zone used to display the timestamps can be configured by setting a system property. Scripting Scripts can read the timestamps from the /timestamps/ URL of each build. For example: /timestamps/ By default, display the elapsed time in seconds with three places after the decimal point. /timestamps/?time=HH:mm:ss&appendLog Display the system clock time and append the line from the log. /timestamps/?elapsed=HH:mm:ss.S&appendLog Display the elapsed time and append the line from the log. /timestamps/?time=HH:mm:ss&elapsed=HH:mm:ss.S Display both the system clock time and the elapsed time. /timestamps/?currentTime&time=HH:mm:ss Display the current time on the Jenkins controller. Supported query parameters: time (since 1.8) Display the system clock time. Accepts the JDK SimpleDateFormat format. \u2139\ufe0f The time zone and locale of the Jenkins controller will be used, unless they are configured with the timeZone and locale query parameters. elapsed (since 1.8) Display the elapsed time since the start of the build. Accepts the Commons Lang DurationFormatUtils format. precision (since 1.3.2) Display the elapsed time in seconds, with a certain number of places after the decimal point. Accepts a number of decimal places or values such as seconds and milliseconds. appendLog (since 1.8) Display the console log line after the timestamp. startLine (since 1.8) Display the timestamps starting from a certain line. Accepts a positive integer to start at that line, or a negative integer to start that many lines back from the end. endLine (since 1.8) Display the timestamps ending at a certain line. Accepts a positive integer to finish at that line, or a negative integer to finish that many lines back from the end. timeZone (since 1.8) Time zone used when displaying the system clock time. Accepts the JDK TimeZone ID format. locale (since 1.8) Select the locale to use when displaying the system clock time. Accepts a locale in the format recognised by Commons Lang LocaleUtils#toLocale. currentTime (since 1.8.8) Display the current time on the Jenkins controller instead of reading timestamps from the build. \ud83d\udd25 Reading the timestamps directly from the file system is not recommended, because the format may change. Java API Since Timestamper 1.8 Other plugins can add a dependency on the Timestamper plugin and then use the TimestamperAPI#read method to retrieve the timestamps. The read method accepts any query string that can be passed to the /timestamps/ URL. For example: import hudson.plugins.timestamper.api.TimestamperAPI; import java.io.BufferedReader; String query = \"time=HH:mm:ss\"; try (BufferedReader reader = TimestamperAPI.get().read(build, query)) { // read timestamps here } Issues Report issues and enhancements in the Jenkins issue tracker.
